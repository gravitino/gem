{"name":"Gem","tagline":"Finding Locally Deformed and Scaled Time Series","body":"### Welcome to the supplementary webpage for the GEM paper\r\n\r\nThis page is intended to give additional information and material including all data sets and source code. \r\n\r\n### cDTW vs. GEM dendrograms\r\n\r\nThis sections provides additional dendrograms obtained on the left split (indices 100-499) of the metal data set. We only state three examples of different types for brevity. All misclassifications of cDTW on this split can be found [here](https://github.com/gempaper/gem/tree/master/results/dendrograms) in pdf of png format. For a given index the upper dendrogram shows the complete linkage clustering for constrained DTW (with learned parameters) and the lower one the same for the GEM similarity measure (with learned parameters). The images are rendered with [DendrogramMetal.py]() -- feel free to edit this file to obtain dendrograms with single or average linkage.\r\n\r\n##### Index 130\r\n![130](https://github.com/gempaper/gem/blob/master/results/dendrograms/dendrogram_cdtw_vs_gem_130.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n##### Index 147\r\n![147](https://github.com/gempaper/gem/blob/master/results/dendrograms/dendrogram_cdtw_vs_gem_147.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n##### Index 152\r\n![152](https://github.com/gempaper/gem/blob/master/results/dendrograms/dendrogram_cdtw_vs_gem_152.png?raw=true)\r\n\r\n### UCR database resampled 1NN\r\n\r\n\r\n| # | dataset |  E_dtw +/- Sigma  | E_gem +/- Sigma    |\r\n|--:|:--------|-------------------|--------------------|\r\n| 0 | 50words | 0.2258 +/- 0.0161 | 0.2495 +/- 0.0202  |\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
